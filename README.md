# Jeffrey Molendijk
Welcome to my Github.io page. This is where I highlight some projects I have recently worked on.

## About me
I am a PhD graduate from the University of Queensland. I primarily use bioinformatics approaches to discover disease-related features. I am focused on developing and implementing novel data science approaches to improve or automate analytical workflows.

## Projects
1. [PubMap](https://jeffreymolendijk.shinyapps.io/PubMap/): An analysis tool for PubMed queries (for confused researchers.)
2. [PostgreSQL in R](https://jeffreymolendijk.github.io/PostgreSQL/): A tutorial on using PostgreSQL in R.
3. [lipidr](https://www.lipidr.org): Data Mining and Analysis of Lipidomics Datasets in R

More projects to be added soon!
